		<h1>Into the Wild</h1>

		<h2>Book Review</h2>

		<p>In April, 1992, a young man from a well-to-do family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. His name was Christopher Johnson McCandless. He had given $25,000 in savings to 
		charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, a party of moose hunters found his body. How McCandless
		 came to die is the unforgettable story of the book, <cite>Into the Wild</cite> by Jon Krakauer. 


		<p>Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned 
		his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and, unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered
		experiences that nature presented. Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw away the maps. Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild </p>.
		
		<h2>Memorable Quotes</h2>

		<q>Nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man’s living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters 
		with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun.”</q> ― Jon Krakauer, Into the Wild

		<p><q>Happiness [is] only real when shared </q> ― Jon Krakauer, Into the Wild

		<q>The sea's only gifts are harsh blows, and occasionally the chance to feel strong. Now I don't know much about the sea, but I do know that that's the way it is here. And I also know how important it is in life 
		not necessarily to be strong but to feel strong. To measure yourself at least once. To find yourself at least once in the most ancient of human conditions. Facing the blind death stone alone, with nothing to help you 
		but your hands and your own head</q> ― Jon Krakauer, Into the Wild
